# Billion Row Challenge

This is small project inspired by another similarly name Java project.

## Generator

A Go binary to generate a billion row text file (csv with 2 columns)
of keys and integers.

## Aggregate

### Rust
A Rust binary to report statistics about the csv file. This is very slow!

### Go
Todo!
